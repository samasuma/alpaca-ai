# Alpaca Voice Assistant AI 

A text to speech reminder app 

# Example Workflow

1. User Action: User speaks a command like "Today I used my shampoo."
2. Speech-to-Text: Use Azure Speech Service to convert the spoken command into text.
3. NLU Processing: Send the text to an NLU API (e.g., Dialogflow, LUIS) to understand the intent ("used shampoo") and extract parameters (timestamp, event description).
4. Calendar Integration: Use the appropriate calendar API (e.g., Google Calendar API) to create an event with the extracted details.
Response: Optionally, send a confirmation response to the user through a messaging API or display a confirmation message in the application interface.

Detailed Workflow Steps:
1. Customer Interaction

    Voice or Text Input
        Customers can call the business or send a voice message.

2. Speech-to-Text Transcription (for voice input)

    Receive Audio
        The audio input (voice message) is captured and sent to the server.

    Transcribe Audio
        Use a speech-to-text API (e.g., Azure Speech Service, Google Speech-to-Text) to convert the audio to text.

3. Text Interpretation

    Analyze Text
        Send the transcribed text (or directly the text input) to an NLP service or model to understand the intent. This could involve:
            Intent Recognition: Determine if the text is requesting to book an appointment, inquire about services, or something else.
            Entity Extraction: Extract relevant details such as preferred date, time, and contact information.

    Determine Action
        Based on the recognized intent and extracted entities, decide the appropriate action (e.g., booking an appointment).

4. Appointment Scheduling

    Check Availability
        Query the business's calendar or booking system to check for available time slots.

    Book Appointment
        Based on customer preferences and availability, book the appointment in the system.

5. Confirmation and Notification
