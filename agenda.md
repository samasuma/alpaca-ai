# Agenda

## Review Current Implementation
- **Check /api/login Endpoint**: Ensure it correctly verifies user credentials against Firebase and locally against the database.
- **Confirm Session Setup**: Verify that `session['user_id']` is being set correctly upon successful authentication.

## Debugging and Testing
- **Test /api/login Endpoint**: Use curl or a tool like Postman to test the login endpoint with valid and invalid credentials.
- **Check Session Data**: After a successful login, inspect the session data to confirm `session['user_id']` is set correctly.

## Adjustment and Fixes
- **Set `session['user_id']`**: Ensure that `session['user_id']` is set immediately after successful authentication, before returning the response.
- **Handle Errors**: Implement error handling for cases where authentication fails (invalid credentials, server errors).

## Update Other Endpoints
- **Secure Endpoints**: Ensure endpoints that require user authentication (`/api/ask-question`, `/api/logout`, etc.) check for `session['user_id']` to determine if the user is authenticated.
- **Implement Authorization**: If necessary, implement authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they are authorized for.

## Documentation and Best Practices
- **Document Session Management**: Update or create documentation on how session management is handled in your Flask application.
- **Security Best Practices**: Review Flask and session management best practices to ensure your application is secure.

## Testing and Deployment
- **Unit Testing**: Write or update unit tests to cover session management and authentication functionality.
- **Deployment**: Deploy changes to a staging environment for further testing before deploying to production.

## Monitoring and Error Handling
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for session-related errors or issues.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging to capture and diagnose session-related issues in production.

## Review and Refactor
- **Code Review**: Conduct a code review to ensure changes are implemented correctly and follow best practices.
- **Refactor**: Refactor code as necessary to improve clarity, performance, or security.

## Next Steps
- **Prepare**: Ensure you have access to the necessary tools and environments (local development, staging, production).
- **Execute**: Follow the agenda step-by-step, focusing on understanding the current state, making necessary adjustments, and thoroughly testing each change.
- **Document**: Document any changes or updates made during the process for future reference and team collaboration.
